h2. Setup

h3. Installing required tools

The project uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ to run tasks and "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ for CSS pre-processing. This creates few dependencies in addition to your normal PHP required by Textpattern. First make sure you have base dependencies installed: "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/, "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/, "Bundler":http://bundler.io/, "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ and "Bower":http://bower.io/. You can install Node, Ruby and "Composer":http://getcomposer.org/ using their installers, Bundler with gem and the rest with npm:

bc. $ gem install bundler
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install -g bower

Consult the tools' documentation for more instructions. Outside from these, the project will also require the normal git, svn, Apache, MySQL and PHP. All requirements must be added to your path variable.

h3. Setting up Apache virtual host

The @public/@ directory is intended to be set as the server's document root. You can do this by adding a new virtual host to your httpd.conf. Along the lines of:

bc.. <VirtualHost *:80>
    VirtualHost "/absolute/path/to/txpmag-website/public"
    ServerName www.txpmag.test
    ServerAlias txpmag.test
</VirtualHost>

# Serve static client-side assets from a different domain.

<VirtualHost *:80>
    VirtualHost "/absolute/path/to/txpmag-website/public/assets"
    ServerName assets.txpmag.test
</VirtualHost>

p. On a local development server, after this you can use your hosts file to point the development domain to correct location (e.g. back to home), run a local DNS server that resolves .test TLDs, or use a "xip.io":http://xip.io/ domain.

h3. Installing dependencies

After you have the base dependencies taken care of, you can install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the project's directory, and run the dependency managers:

bc. $ cd txpmag-website
$ npm install
$ bundle install
$ bower install

*npm* installs Node modules for Grunt, *bundle* takes care of Ruby gems, and *bower* manages client-side scripts.

h3. Installing Textpattern

Once you have Grunt installed, installing and updating Textpattern is easy. To setup or update Textpattern run:

bc. $ grunt setup

This will download the latest development version of Textpattern CMS and place it in the @public/@ directory. Complete the installation as usual by visiting the @/textpattern/setup@ interface, and use "this as your config.php template":https://github.com/textpattern/txpmag-website/blob/master/src/setup/config.dist.php. Further updates can be run with the same command, and are automatic.

h3. Installing plugins

After you have installed Textpattern, you can install plugins the Textpattern installation will be using. Plugins can be installed using Composer:

bc. $ composer install

A 'cache' directory is installed to the root by the 'rah_cache' plugin, make sure that directory is 755 writable.

h2. Building

This repository hosts sources and needs to be built before it can be used. After you have installed all dependencies, you will be able to run tasks using Grunt, including building:

bc. $ grunt [task]

Where the @[task]@ is either @build@, @setup@, @test@ or @watch@.

* The @build@ task builds the project.
* The @setup@ task installs the latest build of Textpattern master branch from GitHub.
* The @test@ task runs JSHint over your JavaScript files, checking the code quality.
* The @watch@ task will launch a task that watches for file changes; the project is then automatically built if a source file is modified.
