h2. Setup

h3. Installing required tools

The project uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ to run tasks and "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ for CSS pre-processing. This creates few dependencies in addition to your normal PHP required by Textpattern. First make sure you have base dependencies installed: "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/, "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/, "Bundler":http://bundler.io/, "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ and "Bower":http://bower.io/. You can install Node and Ruby using their installers, Bunder with gem and the rest with npm:

bc. $ gem install bundler
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install -g bower

Consult the tools' documentation for more instructions. Outside from these, the project will also require the normal git, svn, Apache, MySQL and PHP. All requirements must be added to your path variable.

h3. Installing dependencies

After you have the base dependencies taken care of, you can install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the project's directory, and run the dependency managers:

bc. $ cd txpmag-website
$ npm install
$ bundle install
$ bower install

*npm* installs Node modules for Grunt, *bundle* takes care of Ruby gems, and *bower* manages client-side scripts.

h3. Installing Textpattern

Once you have Grunt installed, installing and updating Textpattern is easy. To setup or update Textpattern run:

bc. $ grunt setup

This will download the latest development version of Textpattern CMS and place it in the @public/@ directory. Complete the installation as usual by visiting the @/textpattern/setup@ interface. Further updates can be run with the same command, and are automatic.

h2. Building

This repository hosts sources and needs to be built before it can be used. After you have installed all dependencies, you will be able to run tasks using Grunt, including building:

bc. $ grunt [task]

Where the @[task]@ is either @test@, @build@, @setup@ or @watch@. Watch will launch a task that watches for file changes. The project is automatically built if a source file is modified. The build task builds the project.
